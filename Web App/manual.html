        <p>If the total added values divided by your age return an even integer, you gain 1 win point. But if it returns an odd number,
            you gain 1 fail point. If you score 5 win points, you won the game, but if you score 5 fail points, you lost the game.
            After that the program has a button for you to choose if you want to play another round. </p>
